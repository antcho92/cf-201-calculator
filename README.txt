6/30/2016: Calculator web app using vanilla javascript for application to Code 301 at Code Fellows. It uses localStorage to save content to browser that is retrievable after a screen refresh.

It is copied from my simple-calculator project but adapted to remove jQuery.

-Added memory functionality. Mimics the windows basic calculator
-To be added: gray out MR, M+, and MC when no use of localStorage
-Need to fix how numbers are brought back with memory recall. Should be added after an operator or replace the current number if there is no operator

7/6
-To be added: single operator functionality, recall functionality fix
-Max number of digits?
-Gray out memory buttons when no memory is saved? Difficult to implement across page reloads

7/7
-To add: help box that explains calculator and what the buttons do
